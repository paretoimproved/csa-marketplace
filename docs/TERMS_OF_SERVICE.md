## Payment Terms

### 5.3 Agricultural Payment Holding Period
**Why We Hold Funds**  
To protect both consumers and farmers, FarmLink retains payments for 7 days to:
1. Verify crop availability and delivery completion
2. Allow time for quality disputes
3. Comply with agricultural trade regulations
4. Prevent fraudulent transactions

**Key Details**:
1. Funds are typically released to farmers 7 calendar days after:
   - Successful produce delivery **AND**  
   - No open disputes/complaints

2. FarmLink deducts our 7% platform fee before releasing funds to farmers  
   *Example: $100 payment â†’ $93 to farmer + $7 platform fee*

3. Holds may extend if:
   - Extreme weather impacts harvest
   - Delivery delays occur
   - Fraud investigation is needed

4. Payouts use Stripe Connect for direct bank transfers
