# FarmLink ðŸŒ±
**Reliable Farm Revenue, Convenient Local Access**

## Project Overview
This project is a react web application that allows local farmers to list their Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) shares and community members to browse and purchase them. The goal is to create a platform that supports local agriculture and fosters a sense of community around shared farming practices.

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites
   - Node.js (v18 or higher)
   - npm (v9 or higher)

2. Installation
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest csa-marketplace -- --template react-ts
   cd csa-marketplace
   npm install
   ```

3. Run Development Server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1 - Basic Features
- User Authentication (Farmers & Customers)
- Basic CSA Share Listings
- Simple Profile Management

### Phase 2 - Core Features

## Core Challenges

### ðŸŒ¾ Farmer Challenges
**Unstable Revenue Streams**  
Small farms remain dependent on volatile markets with:
- No guaranteed weekly income
- High customer acquisition costs
- Limited direct-to-consumer infrastructure

### ðŸ›’ Consumer Pain Points
**Inaccessible Local Food**  
Despite demand, shoppers face:
- Fragmented farm discovery
- Inconvenient pickup options
- No quality standardization

## FarmLink's Solutions

| Farmers Get | Consumers Get |
|-------------|---------------|
| âœ… Predictable CSA income | âœ… One-stop farm discovery |
| âœ… Direct payment processing | âœ… Flexible subscription management |
| âœ… Real-time demand insights | âœ… Verified quality standards |

## Tech Stack Reality Check

**Current Implementation**
```typescript:server/index.ts
startLine: 221
endLine: 244
```
- âœ… Working farm profile system
- âœ… Basic subscription tracking
- âœ… Location management

**Gaps vs MVP Goals**
```prisma:schema.prisma
startLine: 42
endLine: 54
```
- Missing Stripe Connect integration
- No subscription plan models
- Limited product/crop tracking

## Strategic Focus

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Complete Stripe Connect onboarding flow
   - Build subscription plan CRUD interface
   - Implement 10-mile radius search (use existing location data)

2. **Validation Sequencing**
   - Pilot with 3 farms using manual payment tracking
   - Collect consumer feedback on profile pages
   - Delay AI features until core validated

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Add subscription pause/cancel functionality
   - Implement basic dispute resolution system
   - Create farmer payment protection fund

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. **FARMER_ONBOARDING.md**
   - Add visual guide using:
   ```typescript:src/components/farm/FarmProfileView.tsx
   startLine: 7
   endLine: 35
   ```
2. **API_REFERENCE.md**
   - Document existing endpoints:
   ```typescript:server/index.ts
   startLine: 278
   endLine: 302
   ```
3. **ROADMAP.md**
   - Align phase system with current progress:
   ```markdown:README.md
   startLine: 28
   endLine: 43
   ```

Would you like me to generate any of these documentation files in full based on the current codebase?
